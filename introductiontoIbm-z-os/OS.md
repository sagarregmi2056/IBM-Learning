# Operating System & Resource Management

## 1. Role of an Operating System
- Manages **hardware resources** (CPU, memory, I/O devices, storage).
- Provides an environment for applications to run.
- Controls scheduling, multitasking, and priority of jobs.
- Ensures system stability, security, and efficient workload distribution.

---

## 2. Types of Operating Systems
### a) **Batch OS**
- Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.
- Example: **Early IBM Mainframe OS**.

### b) **Time-Sharing OS**
- Supports **multiple users simultaneously** by quickly switching tasks.
- Example: **UNIX, Linux**.
- Mainframe **time-sharing** is key for serving large enterprises with thousands of users.

### c) **Real-Time OS**
- Used for **time-critical tasks** (e.g., medical, military, industrial control).
- Very fast response time.
- Example: **VxWorks, RTLinux**.

### d) **Transaction Processing OS**
- Optimized for **fast transaction processing** (banking, airlines, large retail).
- Example: **z/OS** on mainframes.

### e) **Kernel-based OS**
- The **kernel** is the core that manages CPU, memory, I/O, and processes.
- Examples:
  - **Monolithic Kernel** → Linux
  - **Microkernel** → Minix, QNX
  - **Hybrid Kernel** → Windows NT, macOS

## 3. Mainframe-Specific OS
- **z/OS**
  - Flagship IBM mainframe OS.
  - Runs under **z/Architecture**.
  - Supports **huge workloads** and **high transaction throughput**.
  - Enterprise-grade: banking, telecom, government.

- **Linux on Z**
  - Runs Linux distributions directly on mainframes.
  - Scales Linux workloads (cloud-native apps, containers).

- **z/VM**
  - A **Type-1 Hypervisor** (bare-metal).
  - Hosts thousands of virtual machines (Linux, z/OS guests).

- **z/VSE**
  - Simplified OS for smaller mainframe workloads.

- **z/TPF (Transaction Processing Facility)**
  - Ultra-fast OS designed for **high-volume, low-latency** transaction environments.
  - Used in **airline reservation systems, banking, credit cards**.

## 4. Hypervisors
### **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)**
- Runs directly on hardware.
- Efficient, high-performance.
- Example: **z/VM** on IBM mainframes, VMware ESXi.

### **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**
- Runs on top of an existing OS.
- Easier setup, but slower performance.
- Example: **VirtualBox, VMware Workstation**.

## 5. Resource Management in Mainframe OS
- **CPU scheduling** → prioritize important jobs.
- **Memory management** → virtual memory, paging.
- **I/O management** → channel subsystems handle massive throughput.
- **Workload management (WLM)** → ensures business-critical apps get priority.
- **Security** → tightly controlled user access.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Mainframe OS like **z/OS** specialize in **large-scale workload & transaction management**.  
- **Time-sharing** makes it possible for thousands of users to work simultaneously.  
- **Hypervisors (z/VM)** allow virtualization at scale.  
- Specialized OS exist for different purposes: **Linux (general use)**, **z/TPF (transaction-heavy)**, **kernel-based OS** for flexibility.
