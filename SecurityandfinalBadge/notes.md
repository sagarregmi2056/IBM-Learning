# IBM z/OS Learning Badge

ðŸŽ‰ **Achievement Unlocked:** IBM z/OS Badge  

This repository documents my journey and learning experience while completing the IBM z/OS Learning Track and earning the badge.  

## Overview

The IBM z/OS Learning Track focuses on mainframe concepts, z/OS security, system initialization, cryptography, and workload management. Through this track, I gained hands-on insights into the backbone of enterprise computing systems.  

## Key Learning Points

- **System Security:**  
  - Core objectives: **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**  
  - RACF and its role in managing access  

- **Cryptography & Keys:**  
  - Difference between **secured keys**, **protected keys**, and **clear keys**  
  - Use of **CPACF** for high-performance encryption  

- **IO Architecture:**  
  - **IOCDS** configuration and storage  
  - Logical and physical paths, **Control Units**, and **Channel Paths**  

- **Activation & IPLs:**  
  - Types of **activation profiles**: reset, image, load, group  
  - **Initial Program Load (IPL)** process and SYSRES volume usage  

- **Workload Management:**  
  - **WLM** (Workload Manager) for distributing resources and balancing workloads  

- **Data Handling & Storage:**  
  - **VSAM** (Virtual Storage Access Method), **PDS** (Partitioned Data Set)  
  - Load parameters and **pervasive encryption** for secure data access
